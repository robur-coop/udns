(** The pure interface to the client part of uDns.

    Various helper modules to do with side effects are available from
    {!Dns_client_lwt}, {!Dns_client_unix} and so forth.

    To learn more about the high-level API, I suggest reading the docstrings
    of {!Dns_client_flow}.

(** [query_state] is parameterized over the query type, so the type of
    the representation of the answer depends on what the name server
    was asked to provide. See {!Dns_map.k} for a list of response types.
    The first element (the [int32]) in most of the tuples is the
    Time-To-Live (TTL) field returned from the server, which you can use to
    calculate when you should request fresh information in case you are writing
    a long-running application.

    NB: When querying for [TLSA] records, it is important to use the optional
    [~hostname:false] parameter with the conversion functions within {!Domain_name}
    when constructing the {!Domain_name.t} for the search, since these contain
    labels prefixed with underscores.
