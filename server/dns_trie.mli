(** Prefix tree data structure for domain names

    The key is a {!Dns_name}, whereas the value may be any resource record.  The
    representation is a tree, where the edges are domain name labels, and the
    nodes carry the {{!Dns_packet.rdata}resources}, indexed by resource typ.
    Some special treatment is applied for zones, which must have a start of
    authority entry and a set of name servers.  End of authority, also known as
    delegation, is supported.  Aliases (canonical names, CNAME records) are also
    supported.

    The data structure tries to preserve invariants recommended by the domain
    name system, such as that for any name there may either be an alias or any
    other record, there must be a SOA record, and multiple NS records for an
    authoritative zone, a resource type must have entries of the given type (no
    NS record for A type, the ttl for all resource records of a rrset is the
    same.

(** {1 Abstract trie type} *)

type t
(** The type of the trie. *)

val pp : t Fmt.t
(** [pp ppf t] pretty prints [t] to [ppf]. *)

val empty : t
(** [empty] is the empty trie. *)

(** {1 Operations to modify the trie} *)

val insert_map : Dns_map.t Dns_name.DomMap.t -> t -> t
(** [insert_map m t] inserts all elements of the domain name map [m] into [t]. *)

val insert : Dns_name.t -> Dns_map.v -> t -> t
(** [insert k v t] insert [v] under [k] in [t].  The type is already included in
    [v].  Existing entries are replaced. *)

val remove : Dns_name.t -> Dns_enum.rr_typ -> t -> t
(** [remove k ty t] removes [k, ty] from [t].  If [ty] is {!Dns_enum.ANY}, all
    entries of [k] are removed.  Beware, this may lead to a [t] where the
    initially mentioned invariants are violated. *)

val remove_zone : Dns_name.t -> t -> t
(** [remove_zone name t] remove the zone [name] from [t], retaining subzones
    (entries with [Soa] records).  This removes as well any delegations. *)


(** {1 Checking invariants} *)

val pp_err : err Fmt.t
(** [pp_err ppf err] pretty prints the error [err]. *)

val check : t -> (unit, err) result
(** [check t] checks all invariants. *)


(** {1 Lookup} *)

   | `NotFound of Dns_name.t * int32 * Dns_packet.soa ]) result
(** [lookup k ty t] finds [k, ty] in [t], which may lead to an error.  The
    authority information is returned as well. *)

val lookup_ignore : Dns_name.t -> Dns_enum.rr_typ -> t ->
  (Dns_map.v, unit) result
(** [lookup_ignore k ty t] finds a [k, ty] in [t], which may lead to an error.
    It ignores potential DNS invariants, e.g. that there is no surrounding zone. *)

val entries : Dns_name.t -> t ->

   | `NotAuthoritative
   | `NotFound of Dns_name.t * int32 * Dns_packet.soa ]) result
(** [entries name t] returns either the SOA and all entries for the requested
    [name], or an error. *)

val keys : Dns_name.t -> t -> ((Dns_name.t * Dns_packet.dnskey) list, unit) result
(** [keys name t] returns either all DNSKEY records which have the requested
    [name] as prefix, or an error. *)
