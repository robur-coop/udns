# udns - an opinionated Domain Name System (DNS) library

%%VERSION%%

ÂµDNS supports most of the domain name system used in the wild.  It adheres to
strict conventions.  Failing early and hard.  It is mostly implemented in the
pure fragment of OCaml (no mutation, isolated IO, no exceptions).

It all started out as an experiment to run a recursive resolver, but after
initial prototypes it turned out that every configurable recursive resolver
needs a fully-fledged authoritative nameserver as well (for overriding various
zones such as `.localhost` and reverse lookups of RFC 1918 IP ranges).

Legacy resource record types are not dealt with, and there is no plan to support
`ISDN`, `MAILA`, `MAILB`, `WKS`, `MB`, `NULL`, `HINFO`, ... .  `ANY` and `AXFR`
are only handled via a TCP connection.  The only resource class supported is
`IN` (the Internet).  In a similar vein, wildcard records are _not_ supported,
and it is unlikely they'll ever be in this library.  Truncated hmac in `TSIG`
are not supported (always full length of the hash algorithm).  `EDNS` is not yet
supported (but planned).  The resolver code is not yet ready (and disconnected
from the build system).

Please read [the blog article](https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/DNS) for a more
detailed overview.

## Installation

For now, you have to manually `pin` this library, since this library is not yet
released:

`opam pin add udns https://github.com/roburio/udns.git`

There are three examples in this repository (see the `mirage/examples` directory):
- a primary nameserver with its zone embedded in OCaml code
- a primary nameserver where the zone is parsed at startup from a zonefile
- a secondary nameserver

## Documentation

Is unfortunately only in the code at the moment.
